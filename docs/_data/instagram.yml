⁣
Well behaved meaning code that does what you want⁣
⁣
No one wants unexpected runtime errors⁣
⁣
You need to manage the branches of your logic, specially when something can go wrong and what to do about it⁣
⁣
So there are alternatives to this, I’ll present you 3⁣
⁣
1 Clauses: in case of JavaScript we would need to check stuff out to see it everything is ok, this is known as defensive code⁣
⁣
2 Static Type Checking: like TypeScript, there is a compiler that checks if types are sound, sound meaning everything makes sense⁣
⁣
3 Linters: linters help you check some of this: ⁣ - Are your clauses safe?⁣
- Are your dynamic and/or static types sound?⁣
- Are you following best practices?⁣
⁣
What’s your preferred method to write safe code? ⁣

When you're building your tools you need to make the default use case obvious and simple as possible⁣

The advanced use cases must be hidden, the advanced users will check them, and use them 💪 but the majority won't be overwhelmed by the upfront complexity⁣

Ramda's placeholder is one amazing example of it, it has 2 hidden gems but it seems like a simple curry function, choose well designed tools 🎯⁣

  alt: "First real week of the year, remember to set your goals clear, and strive for more, all you set your mind to do, you will accomplish 🎯⁣⁣
⁣⁣
Let me tell you a story about how to achieve goals, in this case, refactor a big project.⁣⁣
⁣⁣
This big project had a big function that took more than 20 parameters and had thousand lines of code, but it was “the core” of the application, of course.⁣⁣
⁣⁣
When I was refactoring this project I started by moving the function to a new file, that way all commits would be just changing this one file and the team would see this as a separate functions and not the root the main file 🙅‍♂️⁣⁣
⁣⁣
My team and I tried to figure out how, if this big function is almost all the logic, is being called in so many times and with some many parameters, after narrowing down the main points where it should be called we found one issue⁣⁣
⁣⁣
If the big function is only called in strategic places, the parameters are not there yet 🔥⁣⁣
⁣⁣
There’s where Ramda’s curry helped me, if the function is curried, I could see the function as many small functions that needed one parameter o many but not all, that way I could steam-down the partially applied function instead of a bunch of variables that made no sense down the road 🧯⁣⁣
⁣⁣
Later on, I started to take functionalities from the edges of the big function, as far from the roots as possible, this means some arguments are not needed in the big function anymore, but I couldn’t change the interface of the function just like that so I set to use the big function as a facade, keeping the interface intact 🍷⁣⁣
⁣⁣
After weeks of working on refactoring this code we finally separated the concerns and the function was manageable, it would be possible to be that versatile without Ramda’s Curry 🍛⁣⁣
⁣⁣
The bigger the project the hardest is to refactor, you need good tools ⚒️ that allow you to accomplish your mission through time, not every refactor is achievable in one day.⁣⁣

⁣⁣
Yeah you read me right, it’s an art 🖋, because it’s for other humans 👥, it’s main purpose is express intent just like good art⁣⁣
⁣⁣
But there’s a subtle difference in our craft, we are all about performance and efficiency ⚡️⁣⁣
⁣⁣
Our solutions are equally expressive as efficient, we never trade performance 🙅‍♂️ and neither do #cleancode nor #functionalprogramming⁣⁣
⁣⁣
Piping your functions it’s about performance as much as readability, simple yet powerful solutions found in every great architecture from Rome to Unix⁣⁣
⁣⁣
Piping is the founding of mayor civilization feats, and we don’t have that natively in JavaScript... yet! But it’s coming, learn how to pipe like a pro and build your next application with strong millennial-proof concepts.⁣⁣

So you use a “for/do/while” statement... everywhere.

There’re higher abstractions, that hide the basics of a generic for ✏️ and become more expressive 🖋

The big three are Map/Filter/Reduce 3️⃣
👨‍💻
Here is an easy way to know when to use which:
👨‍💻
Map when you need to transform each element of the array to another type, keeping the length of the array.
👨‍💻
Filter when you need a subset of the whole array.
👨‍💻
Reduce when you want to transform the whole array to another type.

I burned hours making code that no one will ever reuse into a weird parameterized version of it.

Learning what to abstract and what not is key, a powerfully abstraction will save everybody’s time ⏰ and money 💰.

But a useless one will make you deliver late and tired of thinking for nothing.

👨‍💻
Once I spend AN ENTIRE YEAR of crunch-time, not healthy, my productivity was practically 0, and the whole code base looked like a monster, every single line from the whole team was ad-hoc solutions because we couldn’t afford time to design better.
👨‍💻
One day I said that’s enough! What are we doing? None of this makes any sense, we’ve decided not to invest the much needed time in best practices that make us more productive, to become a 0 value delivery team because we were too busy delivering instant client gratification.
👨‍💻
I sat down and started write reusable code! Code that’s generic enough that just needs to be partially applied to fit the use case.

Invest YOUR TIME wisely, after spending the right amount making the screws and bolts of your code you can then assemble and build anything light speed ⚡️.

  alt: "The number one dirty code looks like one that uses auxiliary variables to put data from the result of one call function to another.
👨‍💻
Programming with auxiliary variables is not a good sign of a clean coders, you'll see that one person who abuses this (I mean besides using &quot;var i&quot; in for loops) will more often that not destroy your codebase with unreadable/unmaintainable/instant legacy code.
👨‍💻
Object Oriented Programming does not do a good job making obvious Function Composition for starters, it looks like every object must be modeled for its own needs and inheritance will solve it all, that is a BIG MISUNDERSTANDING.
👨‍💻
Rather than inheritance you should always strive for composition, i'm talking to you Joe, not all functions in our 5M lines codebase can inherit from the same &quot;Base Class&quot; 🙄

Engineer your functions, make them &quot;ergonomic&quot; to work with one another, make them fit one another without the need of a third variable.
👨‍💻
Some examples are the functions from Array.prototype, all compose beautifully, they just need one predicate and it's done, think about how Array.map and Array.filter work, they are easy to understand and easy to combine, strive for Good Function Design, and sooner than later, people will be looking at your code as a reference 👀

Supongo que se dieron cuenta de un pequeño efecto... ahora hay más código.
🧑‍💻
Esto es normal, cuando uno busca clean code el numero de lineas no es el asunto ❌
👨‍💻
Pasas más tiempo leyendo código que escribiéndolo, por eso la legibilidad 👁 y reusabilidad ♻️ de tu código es mucho más valioso 🌟

En esta 7ta entrega puedo compartir algunas cosas:
👩‍💻
Este es mi proceso para tener toda la info que necesito en un solo vistazo 🧠
👨‍💻
Pensé en colocar la info que necesitaba en el botón, como la celda y el nombre del archivo que iba a subir, pero me pareció que iba a sobrecargar el pobre botón 👎
🧑‍💻
En algún momento pensé en mostrar la info como una alerta ⚠️ luego de apretar el botón y antes de subir la foto, pero si pudiera verlo de antemano como con el botón sería bueno 👌
👩‍💻
Lo que hice fue utilizar todo el espacio que tenía 🙌 iteré un par de veces y llegue a ese diseño sencillo de dos listas para no perder tanto espacio 🍃
👨‍💻
Como tenía la idea clara y ya tenia más destreza con #cypress y Google API me salió rápido el experimento, fue muy cómodo pensar en las #pruebasautomatizadas y luego #programar la funcionalidad en la app, aunque en ambas tuve que hacer varias iteraciones para que los rangos de consulta estuvieran a Google Spreadsheet API correctos 🎯
🧑‍💻
La primera imagen es parte de la lista de la información en #reactjs &amp; #typescript.
👩‍💻
Y si, estoy consciente de que de que a la función de “addTokenToRandomCell le hace falta un poco de #cleancode 🤣

Que es el dialogo para interactuar de forma sencilla con archivos en servidores de Google, tiene muchas funcionalidades.

En esta 5ta entrega puedo compartir algunas cosas:
👩‍💻
Cometí un grave error, hice algo muy complicado y lento de verificar si estaba correcto.
👨‍💻
De no haber hecho pruebas automatizadas, no le hubiese prestado atención a la complejidad, unos clicks de más y listo, igual cumplía con el “objetivo” 🤷‍♂️
🧑‍💻
Luego de ver que la prueba no terminaba, dije, “no-no” piensa algo más sencillo, ¿que tal si en vez de navegar a la celda que quiero desde la app, pudiera subir la foto a la celda que tengo seleccionada en el Spreadsheet?
👩‍💻
La API no tiene un método para darme la celda activa, entonces pensé ¿y si escribo una palabra clave, que pueda buscar fácil?
👨‍💻
ESCRIBI “asdf” Y BUM 🤯, un botón que me diga en que celda esta eso para hacer un check visual antes de subir el archivo y listo!
🧑‍💻
La diferencia de darse tiempo para encontrar una mejor solución 👌 me hizo recordar la frase de Blaise Pascal “Si tuviera más tiempo, te habría escrito una carta más corta“ 🎯

La parte más difícil de las #pruebasautomatizadas es comenzar, hacer login y pensar en cómo diseñar para poder automatizar.
🧑‍💻
Luego de entender un poco el esquema de autenticación de gapi auth2, me encontré con el problema de ¿cómo evito navegar por el popup de Google? No quiero colocar mis claves en ninguna parte ni crearme una cuenta nueva 🤔
👩‍💻
Resulta que es hasta peligroso hacerlo, Google no lo permite 🚫 y tiene severas consecuencias si encuentra bots, ellos enfatizan que para eso se use su API ✅
👨‍💻
La verdad me costo al rededor de 2 horas solo entender las alternativas de como usar la api de Google, y luego de probar varías de las que encontré documentadas, se me ocurrió este camino, lo escribí en 1 segundo, solo para descartarlo, pero funcionó 😹
🧑‍💻
Si se dan cuenta también pueden observar “GSE1..8” en el titulo de las pruebas, esa es la técnica que enseñé en mi publicación anterior (la del arroz), mediante vaya avanzando podrán ver otras bondades que trae esa técnica 👌
👩‍💻
Pueden observar en el video el query string del token, y como pruebo que aparezcan los botones de autenticar si no proveo el token, también hago skip de la prueba del “el botón de sign-out” porque para probarlo tendría que estar autenticado y ese flujo no lo automatizaré.

  alt: "Antes de continuar con las #pruebasautomatizadas, quería adquirir un poco de conocimiento sobre como autenticar Google API en el browser ya que para las pruebas utilice la librería de #nodejs.
🧑‍💻
El código de ejemplo volvió a ser más 🍝 de lo que esperaba, así que de nuevo decidí dedicarle un poco de cariño y desenredar 🧶
👩‍💻
Por suerte ya tengo un poco de experiencia modelando con XState, así que esta vez fue rápido, solo era cuestión de tener la documentación a mano y ponerle.
👨‍💻
Me encanta XState, reemplazo por completo Redux para mi, una de las cosas que más me gusta es su buena integración con #typescript 👌
🧑‍💻
XState fue creado por @davidkpiano y anuncia en su readme “State machines and statecharts for the modern web” que lo podría traducir como “Máquinas de estado y grafos de estado para la web moderna”.
👩‍💻
Es decir, es una herramienta 🔧 para manejar estados, pero cuenta con estados finitos (ej: encendido, apagado), “grafos” que permiten que uno salte entre estados padres e hijos y un estado infinito como el que ya conocemos en Redux (el Store donde se almacena un objeto cualquiera).
👨‍💻
XState me parece una herramienta fundamental para hacer #programaciónfuncional y #cleancode en la web, organiza, vuelve todo legible y fácil de alterar, porque todo esta en su lugar (en un estado finito)🧹

  alt: "¿Cómo terminar de sacarle el provecho a tus pruebas automatizadas? 👉
👨‍💻
En el bote estamos todos, a todas las areas le afecta la calidad del producto desde el mismo programador hasta el area de ventas, el primer paso para subir tu nivel de programador es hacer pruebas primero. Lo repetiré de nuevo, HACER LAS PRUEBAS.
👩‍💻
Para vencer el fricción de sentarte y hacer pruebas, tienes que dejar ir la mentalidad que tienes al programar una característica principal, no es igual, tienes que estar abierto a ver las cosas desde otra perspectiva y tienes que cultivar esa mentalidad.
👨‍💻
Vivien Ibironke Ibiyemi, tiene algo llamado “Mindset tool”(MT) que podría traducirlo como “Herramienta de Mentalidad”, las consiguió observando como los demás eran mejor que ella encontrando bugs, ella define algunas:
👩‍💻
🧠 MT de Usuario.
🧠 MT Ya probé.
🧠 MT de Lazy Tester.
🧠 MT Analítica.
🧠 MT de Pensamiento crítico.
🧠 MT de Curiosidad.
🧠 MT de Convicción de errores.
🧠 MT de Comunicador.
🧠 MT de Confianza, Empresarial.
🧠 MT Líder del equipo.
🧠 MT de Manejo de críticas y acusaciones.
🧠 MT de Manejo de la vergüenza.
👨‍💻
Cambiando su perspectiva, esta mejor preparada para afrontar la situación y ¿acaso ser un programador no es ver el mundo desde otra perspectiva completamente distinta?

Etiqueta a un amigo (o empresa) que necesite este consejo 📦

  alt: "Otro método de testing para que le saques más provecho a tus tests 🙌.
-
Llegó un punto en el que necesitaba ser más robusto y probar casos tediosos, porque errores como no probar una combinación clásica de un string (string vacío por ejemplo), me causaba un bug en producción 🙄 o la diferencia entre un valor falsy o nil, las funciones a veces esperaban undefined, pero se comportaban mal con 0, false, null, {}, ‘’, [] 🤦‍♂️…
-
Se me ocurrió hacer mis propios matchers en Jest, pero era medio molesto repetirlos de proyecto en proyecto, ¿tal vez publicar un paquete?, hasta que descubrí esta maravilla ✨.
-
QUICKCHECK, inventado por Koen Claessen @koenclaessen y John Hughes, anuncia en su página “QuickCheck is a tool for testing Haskell programs automatically”, (QuickCheck es una herramienta para probar programas en Haskell automáticamente”.
-
Quick Check esta portado a muchos lenguajes de programación y creo que en #javascript y #typescript la mejor implementación es “fast-check” y la documentación esta 👌. Es decir, quick-check se encarga de generar datos (string vacío, extremadamente largo, con caracteres especiales, etc), la distribución de estos datos, estadísticos entenderán la importancia, y corre muchas veces la prueba con todos estos datos para asegurar que la función correctamente maneja esto.

Esto no solo significa que te ayuda a automatizar casos de prueba tediosos, sino que lo mas probable encuentre bugs que nunca pensaste que existían en tu código, tanto es así que las implementaciones de QuickCheck siempre se enorgullecen de encontrar errores en librerías altamente utilizadas (fast-check incluso encontró un bug en Jest 😳. ¿Qué piensas de este método 🤔? ¿lo conocías?

-
Te ofrezco algunos argumentos para ayudarte en una de las misiones más importantes de hoy en día:
- Convencer a tu equipo de que apuntar a la calidad de software es mejorar la productividad y calidad de vida de todas las áreas de la empresa.
-
¿Has podido convencer a tu equipo de usar TDD? ¿Qué sientes sobre TDD? -
Mandame un DM si tienes preguntas sobre TDD o te gustaría cubrir de pruebas tu producto. ¿POR QUÉ TDD?
¿CUÁL ES EL OBJETIVO DE UN/A PROGRAMADOR/A? 🤔
SOLUCIONAR PROBLEMAS 🎯
¿Pero cómo sabes que tu solución es la correcta? 😕
Test Driven Development o Desarrollo Guiado por Pruebas en español, es un proceso de desarrollo de software, consiste en un corto ciclo de desarrollo:
.
1 REQUERIMIENTOS SON CONVERTIDOS EN CASOS DE PRUEBAS MUY ESPECÍFICOS.
.
2 ESTAS SE PROGRAMAN Y SE VERIFICA QUE FALLEN.
.
3 LUEGO SE IMPLEMENTA EL CÓDIGO QUE HACE QUE LA PRUEBA PASE.
.
4 Y POR ÚLTIMO SE REFACTORIZA EL CÓDIGO ESCRITO (para eliminar redundancias).
.
TDD ofrece más beneficios que solo evaluar que el #software esté correcto, te ayuda a:
-DISEÑAR enfocándote en el caso de uso primero imaginando como va a ser usada tu solución.
- ENFOCARTE en un pequeño objetivo (hacer que la prueba pase).
- Y ERRADICA EL MIEDO DE HACER modificaciones futuras. ¿Te ha costado convencer a tu #equipoingeniero de utilizar tdd?
