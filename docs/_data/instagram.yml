Obvs this is the cutest design I've found so far, what do you think of it?

This design is available for purchase in 49 diff products, link in my bio ✨

This artist has adorable designs, and it looks lovely in a pillow.

I plan to do more Instagram story polls to see which one are other designs you might like.

I'm trying to see what type of content is more Instagram friendly, and maybe leave more tech-heavy things to Medium (blog) and YouTube.

Why? Because Instagram content is not indexable, nor ever-green, so people cannot find things later. 

In resume, this is my next ig strategy:
- Merch for you
- Carrousels about new blog posts
- Teasers from new YouTube vids

What do you think?

  alt: "Agree or disagree?

Don't you get annoyed when you install and app and immediately starts sending you a bunch of notifications?

IT'S THE WORST!

What about the \"hey, come see this?\" (I'm looking at you tiktok 👀)

Shouldn't that be illegal? Like bad for mental health!

What I do about it? Well, after installing an app is disable all kind of push/email notifications!

But shouldn't this be the default behaviour?

Maybe iOS will make this behavior a default in future versions?

State machines make my code easier to understand, and also, to explain!

  alt: "How good is the quality of your sleep❓⁣
⁣
1. You sleep deeply from 7-9 hours a day every day.⁣
2. You get good sleep some days of the week.⁣
3. You rarely sleep well.⁣
4. What's sleep, lol.⁣
⁣
If you're anything like me, then the answer is 2 or 3 fluctuating on your life's events.⁣
⁣
I used to sleep aaaaall the time before 21, but after I graduated from University and started working my sleep quality went to 💩⁣
⁣
Mainly because I didn't give importance, I wanted to learn and do everything! I needed more hours in the day!!⁣
⁣
But eventually, my focus and decision making started to decline to dramatically low levels. When I checked out, I was sleeping 3 to 4 hours a day, for months by then.⁣
⁣
I changed my lifestyle since that moment, my brain is my most important asset, and I was killing it rather quickly.⁣
⁣
It's also challenging to get adequate sleep with the light of our computers and the urges from work.⁣
⁣
Once you master focus, programming until 2am regularly is bound to happen.⁣
⁣
At first, we get so much done, but with time all we produce is rubbish.⁣
⁣
I've put resources to help you sleep better and avoid suffering as much as I did due to my recklessness, join me at @codingedgar to stay tunned.⁣

  alt: "Can you recommend me YouTube channels with intros you love❓

I think I need some minimalist intro, some 1-5 seconds music with maybe a small animation or something.

I love watching YouTube podcasts or channels that have a catching intro and are quick! Just enough to create a familiar environment.

I like when the video has a quick intro to what will be said (without spoilers of course), then the intro comes into place 🎶  and then the video starts.

How do I know an intro is good? When I find myself humming the intro for a few seconds.

I also find channels that have the same intro as the outro, which is nice!

Why am I doing this now?

Well... in my last video I forgot to present myself, and the channel🤦‍♂️. Also, I enjoy too much catching intros/outros to ignore them for much longer.

I didn't want to spend too much time on the video editing process at first, but I do want to improve 1% every week, so I want to add an intro/outro next.

I talk more about the key things I enjoyed from this site on YouTube, link in bio 🔥

What is web.dev?

Is an effort from the Google Chrome team:
A site dedicated to documenting best-practices and the ability to monitor your site to ensure you always were able to keep it fast, resilient and accessible.

On the learning side, they have structured learning paths to discover everything you need to know about building for the modern web, like: 

- Performance
- Web vitals
- Metrics
- Fast load times.
- Progressive Web Apps
- Accessibility
- Network reliability
- Web Payments
- Security
- React
- Angular
- and how to use Lighthouse

All of this is in such a great depth and thought for learners. I must say, the quality of the content is impressive.

On the learning side, you can test:
Performance
Best Practices
SEO
and Accessibility
The test is free, only requires an URL, and the result has excellent accuracy and tips on improving the score of your website.

❓
Where do you go for references: Mozilla's MDN or Google's web.dev? Or do you go somewhere else?

  alt: "What is the Contact Picker API?

Access to the user's contacts on a mobile device has been a feature of iOS/Android apps since (almost) the dawn of time. It's one of the most common feature requests I hear from web developers, and is often the key reason they build an iOS/Android app.

Available in Chrome 80 on Android, the Contact Picker API is an on-demand API that allows users to select entries from their contact list and share limited details of the selected entries with a website. It allows users to share only what they want, when they want, and makes it easier for users to reach and connect with their friends and family.

The entry point to the Contact Picker API is navigator.contacts.select(). When called, it returns a promise and shows the contact picker, allowing the user to select the contact(s) they want to share with the site. After selecting what to share and clicking Done, the promise resolves with an array of contacts selected by the user.

📜📜📜📜 👀 
I discovered this feature in a fantastic video from @fireship_dev.

  alt: "Did you know you can add app shortcuts in your PWA?

The web platform now supports app shortcuts to improve users' productivity and facilitate re-engagement with key tasks.

They allow web developers to provide quick access to a handful of common actions that users need frequently.

Each app shortcut expresses a user intent, each of which is associated with a URL within the scope of your web app. The URL is opened when users activate the app shortcut. Examples of app shortcuts include the following:
- Top-level navigation items (e.g., home, timeline, recent orders)
- Search
- Data entry tasks (e.g., compose an email or tweet, add a receipt)
- Activities (e.g., start a chat with the most popular contacts)

  alt: "Did you know the Logical OR Assignment?

There has been 2 kinds of Assignment Operators in JavaScript (besides the actual Assignment Operator =)
Arithmetic Assignment Operators, like +=, *=, -=.
Bitwise Operators <<=, >>>=, ^=, &=.

But there's a new kind of operators ready for you to use today in JavaScript, called: Logical Assignment Operators.

Today I'm going to show you the Logical OR Assignment.

The logical OR assignment (x ||= y) operator only assigns if x is falsy.

The logical OR operator works like this:

x || y;
// returns x when x is truthy
// returns y when x is not truthy

The logical OR operator short-circuits: the second operand is only evaluated if the first operand doesn’t already determine the result.

Logical OR assignment short-circuits as well, meaning it only performs an assignment if the logical operation would evaluate the right-hand side. In other words, x ||= y is equivalent to:

x || (x = y);

And not equivalent to the following which would always perform an assignment:

x = x || y;

Note that this behavior is different to mathematical and bitwise assignment operators.

I explained this operator in more detail, on YouTube and Medium, wanna watch the video?⁣⁣⁣⁣

The logical AND operator is evaluated left to right, it is tested for possible short-circuit evaluation using the following rule:
(some falsy expression) && expr is short-circuit evaluated to the falsy expression;

Short circuit means that the expr part above is not evaluated, hence any side effects of doing so do not take effect (e.g., if expr is a function call, the calling never takes place).

Logical AND assignment short-circuits as well meaning that x &&= y is equivalent to:

x && (x = y);

And not equivalent to the following which would always perform an assignment:

x = x && y;

I explained this operator in more detail, on YouTube and Medium, wanna watch the video?⁣⁣⁣⁣

  alt: "A new category of operators in JavaScript ✨

There has been 2 kinds of Assignment Operators in JavaScript (besides the actual Assignment Operator =)
- Arithmetic Assignment Operators, like +=, *=, -=.
- Bitwise Operators <<=, >>>=, ^=, &=.

But there's a new kind of operators ready for you to use today in JavaScript, called: Logical Assignment Operators.

Today I'm going to show you Logical Nullish Assignment.

The Logical Nullish Assignment (x ??= y) operator only assigns if x is nullish (null or undefined).

The Nullish Coalescing Operator is evaluated left to right, it is tested for possible short-circuit evaluation using the following rule:

(some expression that is neither null nor undefined) ?? expr is short-circuit evaluated to the left-hand side expression if the left-hand side proves to be neither null nor undefined.

Short circuit means that the expr part above is not evaluated, hence any side effects of doing so do not take effect (e.g., if expr is a function call, the calling never takes place).

Logical nullish assignment short-circuits as well meaning that x ??= y is equivalent to:

x ?? (x = y);

And not equivalent to the following which would always perform an assignment:

x = x ?? y;

  alt: "Wanna know the story behind this video? 👇⁣
⁣
I had problems with the audio in my last video, so I decided to put my headphones on, and do some audio monitoring while recording, which helped me a lot because I actually caught errors in my recording and could act accordingly.⁣
⁣
However, my own voice distracted me so much that I ended up speaking really really slow, and it sounds weird like I'm having a stroke or something. 😞⁣
⁣
I thought:⁣
Should I re-do the video?⁣
Should I try to edit the speed?⁣
⁣
And I ended up doing neither!⁣
⁣
If I re-do the video, I'll probably get so tyred that it will make a dent on my motivation and flow.⁣
⁣
I believe that achieving proficiency is more about showing every day and learning from each opportunity, not getting stuck in trying to make everything perfect on the first try.⁣
⁣
I tried to edit the speed, and couldn't come up with a good result.⁣
⁣
Yet, while making this post, I discovered the right way to speed up the video maintaining my voice pitch, which if not done right, makes me sound like a Looney Tunes character.⁣
⁣
So, I ended up with the regular video speed and added half a second funny notes on the video recommending using the speed-up of YouTube.⁣
⁣
Would people notice? I don't know.⁣
Is the best I could do (technically speaking)? No.⁣
Is the best I could do for my process and goals? Yes, it is.⁣

If you’ve never heard about the OpenJS Foundation, you probably have two questions in mind, let me answer those:

What is the purpose of the OpenJS Foundation?

-Promote the widespread adoption and development of key JavaScript solutions and related technologies.

And where did they come from?
- 2006 jQuery is created.
- 2009 jQuery Joins the Software Freedom Conservancy
- 2012 jQuery Foundation, as an independent organization is formed.
- 2016 Dojo Foundation merges with jQuery Foundation, later rebranding itself as JS Foundation, and becomes a Linux Foundation Program.
- 2019 The Node.js Foundation merges with the JS Foundation to form OpenJS Foundation, to foster healthy growth of the JavaScript and web ecosystem as a whole.

  alt: "Some languages help you more than others to write well behaved code⁣
⁣
Well behaved meaning code that does what you want⁣
⁣
No one wants unexpected runtime errors⁣
⁣
You need to manage the branches of your logic, specially when something can go wrong and what to do about it⁣
⁣
So there are alternatives to this, I’ll present you 3⁣
⁣
1 Clauses: in case of JavaScript we would need to check stuff out to see it everything is ok, this is known as defensive code⁣
⁣
2 Static Type Checking: like TypeScript, there is a compiler that checks if types are sound, sound meaning everything makes sense⁣
⁣
3 Linters: linters help you check some of this: ⁣ - Are your clauses safe?⁣
- Are your dynamic and/or static types sound?⁣
- Are you following best practices?⁣
⁣
What’s your preferred method to write safe code? ⁣

When you're building your tools you need to make the default use case obvious and simple as possible⁣

The advanced use cases must be hidden, the advanced users will check them, and use them 💪 but the majority won't be overwhelmed by the upfront complexity⁣

  alt: "First real week of the year, remember to set your goals clear, and strive for more, all you set your mind to do, you will accomplish 🎯⁣⁣
⁣⁣
Let me tell you a story about how to achieve goals, in this case, refactor a big project.⁣⁣
⁣⁣
This big project had a big function that took more than 20 parameters and had thousand lines of code, but it was “the core” of the application, of course.⁣⁣
⁣⁣
When I was refactoring this project I started by moving the function to a new file, that way all commits would be just changing this one file and the team would see this as a separate functions and not the root the main file 🙅‍♂️⁣⁣
⁣⁣
My team and I tried to figure out how, if this big function is almost all the logic, is being called in so many times and with some many parameters, after narrowing down the main points where it should be called we found one issue⁣⁣
⁣⁣
If the big function is only called in strategic places, the parameters are not there yet 🔥⁣⁣
⁣⁣
There’s where Ramda’s curry helped me, if the function is curried, I could see the function as many small functions that needed one parameter o many but not all, that way I could steam-down the partially applied function instead of a bunch of variables that made no sense down the road 🧯⁣⁣
⁣⁣
Later on, I started to take functionalities from the edges of the big function, as far from the roots as possible, this means some arguments are not needed in the big function anymore, but I couldn’t change the interface of the function just like that so I set to use the big function as a facade, keeping the interface intact 🍷⁣⁣
⁣⁣
After weeks of working on refactoring this code we finally separated the concerns and the function was manageable, it would be possible to be that versatile without Ramda’s Curry 🍛⁣⁣
⁣⁣
The bigger the project the hardest is to refactor, you need good tools ⚒️ that allow you to accomplish your mission through time, not every refactor is achievable in one day.⁣⁣

⁣⁣
Yeah you read me right, it’s an art 🖋, because it’s for other humans 👥, it’s main purpose is express intent just like good art⁣⁣
⁣⁣
But there’s a subtle difference in our craft, we are all about performance and efficiency ⚡️⁣⁣
⁣⁣
Our solutions are equally expressive as efficient, we never trade performance 🙅‍♂️ and neither do #cleancode nor #functionalprogramming⁣⁣
⁣⁣
Piping your functions it’s about performance as much as readability, simple yet powerful solutions found in every great architecture from Rome to Unix⁣⁣
⁣⁣
Piping is the founding of mayor civilization feats, and we don’t have that natively in JavaScript... yet! But it’s coming, learn how to pipe like a pro and build your next application with strong millennial-proof concepts.⁣⁣

So you use a “for/do/while” statement... everywhere.

There’re higher abstractions, that hide the basics of a generic for ✏️ and become more expressive 🖋

The big three are Map/Filter/Reduce 3️⃣

Here is an easy way to know when to use which:
👨‍💻
Map when you need to transform each element of the array to another type, keeping the length of the array.
👨‍💻
Filter when you need a subset of the whole array.
👨‍💻
Reduce when you want to transform the whole array to another type.

👨‍💻
Once I spend AN ENTIRE YEAR of crunch-time, not healthy, my productivity was practically 0, and the whole code base looked like a monster, every single line from the whole team was ad-hoc solutions because we couldn’t afford time to design better.
👨‍💻
One day I said that’s enough! What are we doing? None of this makes any sense, we’ve decided not to invest the much needed time in best practices that make us more productive, to become a 0 value delivery team because we were too busy delivering instant client gratification.
👨‍💻
I sat down and started write reusable code! Code that’s generic enough that just needs to be partially applied to fit the use case.

Invest YOUR TIME wisely, after spending the right amount making the screws and bolts of your code you can then assemble and build anything light speed ⚡️.

  alt: "The number one dirty code looks like one that uses auxiliary variables to put data from the result of one call function to another.
👨‍💻
Programming with auxiliary variables is not a good sign of a clean coders, you'll see that one person who abuses this (I mean besides using &quot;var i&quot; in for loops) will more often that not destroy your codebase with unreadable/unmaintainable/instant legacy code.
👨‍💻
Object Oriented Programming does not do a good job making obvious Function Composition for starters, it looks like every object must be modeled for its own needs and inheritance will solve it all, that is a BIG MISUNDERSTANDING.
👨‍💻
Rather than inheritance you should always strive for composition, i'm talking to you Joe, not all functions in our 5M lines codebase can inherit from the same &quot;Base Class&quot; 🙄

Engineer your functions, make them &quot;ergonomic&quot; to work with one another, make them fit one another without the need of a third variable.
👨‍💻
Some examples are the functions from Array.prototype, all compose beautifully, they just need one predicate and it's done, think about how Array.map and Array.filter work, they are easy to understand and easy to combine, strive for Good Function Design, and sooner than later, people will be looking at your code as a reference 👀

👩‍💻
Este es mi proceso para tener toda la info que necesito en un solo vistazo 🧠
👨‍💻
Pensé en colocar la info que necesitaba en el botón, como la celda y el nombre del archivo que iba a subir, pero me pareció que iba a sobrecargar el pobre botón 👎
🧑‍💻
En algún momento pensé en mostrar la info como una alerta ⚠️ luego de apretar el botón y antes de subir la foto, pero si pudiera verlo de antemano como con el botón sería bueno 👌
👩‍💻
Lo que hice fue utilizar todo el espacio que tenía 🙌 iteré un par de veces y llegue a ese diseño sencillo de dos listas para no perder tanto espacio 🍃
👨‍💻
Como tenía la idea clara y ya tenia más destreza con #cypress y Google API me salió rápido el experimento, fue muy cómodo pensar en las #pruebasautomatizadas y luego #programar la funcionalidad en la app, aunque en ambas tuve que hacer varias iteraciones para que los rangos de consulta estuvieran a Google Spreadsheet API correctos 🎯
🧑‍💻
La primera imagen es parte de la lista de la información en #reactjs &amp; #typescript.
👩‍💻
Y si, estoy consciente de que de que a la función de “addTokenToRandomCell le hace falta un poco de #cleancode 🤣

En esta 5ta entrega puedo compartir algunas cosas:
👩‍💻
Cometí un grave error, hice algo muy complicado y lento de verificar si estaba correcto.
👨‍💻
De no haber hecho pruebas automatizadas, no le hubiese prestado atención a la complejidad, unos clicks de más y listo, igual cumplía con el “objetivo” 🤷‍♂️
🧑‍💻
Luego de ver que la prueba no terminaba, dije, “no-no” piensa algo más sencillo, ¿que tal si en vez de navegar a la celda que quiero desde la app, pudiera subir la foto a la celda que tengo seleccionada en el Spreadsheet?
👩‍💻
La API no tiene un método para darme la celda activa, entonces pensé ¿y si escribo una palabra clave, que pueda buscar fácil?
👨‍💻
ESCRIBI “asdf” Y BUM 🤯, un botón que me diga en que celda esta eso para hacer un check visual antes de subir el archivo y listo!
🧑‍💻
La diferencia de darse tiempo para encontrar una mejor solución 👌 me hizo recordar la frase de Blaise Pascal “Si tuviera más tiempo, te habría escrito una carta más corta“ 🎯

La parte más difícil de las #pruebasautomatizadas es comenzar, hacer login y pensar en cómo diseñar para poder automatizar.
🧑‍💻
Luego de entender un poco el esquema de autenticación de gapi auth2, me encontré con el problema de ¿cómo evito navegar por el popup de Google? No quiero colocar mis claves en ninguna parte ni crearme una cuenta nueva 🤔
👩‍💻
Resulta que es hasta peligroso hacerlo, Google no lo permite 🚫 y tiene severas consecuencias si encuentra bots, ellos enfatizan que para eso se use su API ✅
👨‍💻
La verdad me costo al rededor de 2 horas solo entender las alternativas de como usar la api de Google, y luego de probar varías de las que encontré documentadas, se me ocurrió este camino, lo escribí en 1 segundo, solo para descartarlo, pero funcionó 😹
🧑‍💻
Si se dan cuenta también pueden observar “GSE1..8” en el titulo de las pruebas, esa es la técnica que enseñé en mi publicación anterior (la del arroz), mediante vaya avanzando podrán ver otras bondades que trae esa técnica 👌
👩‍💻
Pueden observar en el video el query string del token, y como pruebo que aparezcan los botones de autenticar si no proveo el token, también hago skip de la prueba del “el botón de sign-out” porque para probarlo tendría que estar autenticado y ese flujo no lo automatizaré.

  alt: "Antes de continuar con las #pruebasautomatizadas, quería adquirir un poco de conocimiento sobre como autenticar Google API en el browser ya que para las pruebas utilice la librería de #nodejs.
🧑‍💻
El código de ejemplo volvió a ser más 🍝 de lo que esperaba, así que de nuevo decidí dedicarle un poco de cariño y desenredar 🧶
👩‍💻
Por suerte ya tengo un poco de experiencia modelando con XState, así que esta vez fue rápido, solo era cuestión de tener la documentación a mano y ponerle.
👨‍💻
Me encanta XState, reemplazo por completo Redux para mi, una de las cosas que más me gusta es su buena integración con #typescript 👌
🧑‍💻
XState fue creado por @davidkpiano y anuncia en su readme “State machines and statecharts for the modern web” que lo podría traducir como “Máquinas de estado y grafos de estado para la web moderna”.
👩‍💻
Es decir, es una herramienta 🔧 para manejar estados, pero cuenta con estados finitos (ej: encendido, apagado), “grafos” que permiten que uno salte entre estados padres e hijos y un estado infinito como el que ya conocemos en Redux (el Store donde se almacena un objeto cualquiera).
👨‍💻
XState me parece una herramienta fundamental para hacer #programaciónfuncional y #cleancode en la web, organiza, vuelve todo legible y fácil de alterar, porque todo esta en su lugar (en un estado finito)🧹

  alt: "¿Cómo terminar de sacarle el provecho a tus pruebas automatizadas? 👉
👨‍💻
En el bote estamos todos, a todas las areas le afecta la calidad del producto desde el mismo programador hasta el area de ventas, el primer paso para subir tu nivel de programador es hacer pruebas primero. Lo repetiré de nuevo, HACER LAS PRUEBAS.
👩‍💻
Para vencer el fricción de sentarte y hacer pruebas, tienes que dejar ir la mentalidad que tienes al programar una característica principal, no es igual, tienes que estar abierto a ver las cosas desde otra perspectiva y tienes que cultivar esa mentalidad.
👨‍💻
Vivien Ibironke Ibiyemi, tiene algo llamado “Mindset tool”(MT) que podría traducirlo como “Herramienta de Mentalidad”, las consiguió observando como los demás eran mejor que ella encontrando bugs, ella define algunas:
👩‍💻
🧠 MT de Usuario.
🧠 MT Ya probé.
🧠 MT de Lazy Tester.
🧠 MT Analítica.
🧠 MT de Pensamiento crítico.
🧠 MT de Curiosidad.
🧠 MT de Convicción de errores.
🧠 MT de Comunicador.
🧠 MT de Confianza, Empresarial.
🧠 MT Líder del equipo.
🧠 MT de Manejo de críticas y acusaciones.
🧠 MT de Manejo de la vergüenza.
👨‍💻
Cambiando su perspectiva, esta mejor preparada para afrontar la situación y ¿acaso ser un programador no es ver el mundo desde otra perspectiva completamente distinta?
👩‍💻
Etiqueta a un amigo (o empresa) que necesite este consejo 📦

  alt: "Otro método de testing para que le saques más provecho a tus tests 🙌.
-
Llegó un punto en el que necesitaba ser más robusto y probar casos tediosos, porque errores como no probar una combinación clásica de un string (string vacío por ejemplo), me causaba un bug en producción 🙄 o la diferencia entre un valor falsy o nil, las funciones a veces esperaban undefined, pero se comportaban mal con 0, false, null, {}, ‘’, [] 🤦‍♂️…
-
Se me ocurrió hacer mis propios matchers en Jest, pero era medio molesto repetirlos de proyecto en proyecto, ¿tal vez publicar un paquete?, hasta que descubrí esta maravilla ✨.
-
QUICKCHECK, inventado por Koen Claessen @koenclaessen y John Hughes, anuncia en su página “QuickCheck is a tool for testing Haskell programs automatically”, (QuickCheck es una herramienta para probar programas en Haskell automáticamente”.
-
Quick Check esta portado a muchos lenguajes de programación y creo que en #javascript y #typescript la mejor implementación es “fast-check” y la documentación esta 👌. Es decir, quick-check se encarga de generar datos (string vacío, extremadamente largo, con caracteres especiales, etc), la distribución de estos datos, estadísticos entenderán la importancia, y corre muchas veces la prueba con todos estos datos para asegurar que la función correctamente maneja esto.

Esto no solo significa que te ayuda a automatizar casos de prueba tediosos, sino que lo mas probable encuentre bugs que nunca pensaste que existían en tu código, tanto es así que las implementaciones de QuickCheck siempre se enorgullecen de encontrar errores en librerías altamente utilizadas (fast-check incluso encontró un bug en Jest 😳. ¿Qué piensas de este método 🤔? ¿lo conocías?

  alt: "¡Convence a tu equipo de hacer TDD! ⏬
-
Te ofrezco algunos argumentos para ayudarte en una de las misiones más importantes de hoy en día:
- Convencer a tu equipo de que apuntar a la calidad de software es mejorar la productividad y calidad de vida de todas las áreas de la empresa.
-
¿Has podido convencer a tu equipo de usar TDD? ¿Qué sientes sobre TDD? -
Mandame un DM si tienes preguntas sobre TDD o te gustaría cubrir de pruebas tu producto. ¿POR QUÉ TDD?
¿CUÁL ES EL OBJETIVO DE UN/A PROGRAMADOR/A? 🤔
SOLUCIONAR PROBLEMAS 🎯
¿Pero cómo sabes que tu solución es la correcta? 😕
Test Driven Development o Desarrollo Guiado por Pruebas en español, es un proceso de desarrollo de software, consiste en un corto ciclo de desarrollo:
.
1 REQUERIMIENTOS SON CONVERTIDOS EN CASOS DE PRUEBAS MUY ESPECÍFICOS.
.
2 ESTAS SE PROGRAMAN Y SE VERIFICA QUE FALLEN.
.
3 LUEGO SE IMPLEMENTA EL CÓDIGO QUE HACE QUE LA PRUEBA PASE.
.
4 Y POR ÚLTIMO SE REFACTORIZA EL CÓDIGO ESCRITO (para eliminar redundancias).
.
TDD ofrece más beneficios que solo evaluar que el #software esté correcto, te ayuda a:
-DISEÑAR enfocándote en el caso de uso primero imaginando como va a ser usada tu solución.
- ENFOCARTE en un pequeño objetivo (hacer que la prueba pase).
- Y ERRADICA EL MIEDO DE HACER modificaciones futuras. ¿Te ha costado convencer a tu #equipoingeniero de utilizar tdd?

  alt: "¿Por qué siempre fijar las #versiones de tus dependencias en #nodejs ?.
Por defecto las #dependencias en #nodejs se instalan con un mecanismo de actualizaciones automáticas si estas son menores o parches, esto es para tener lo antes posible #actualizaciones de #seguridad.
.
Sin embargo, esto puede obligarte a invertir horas en diagnosticar un #bug que parece salido de la nada, en medio de un momento critico.
.
Hoy puedes utilizar #bots en @github #gitlab #bitbucket, que generan automáticamente #pullrequest o #mergerequest con actualizaciones de dependencias, permitiendo que te enfoques en un problema a la vez.
.
¿Qué opinas tú? ¿También prefieres fijar las versiones de tus dependencias? ¿Por qué? ¿Por qué no? Deja tu comentario 😉
