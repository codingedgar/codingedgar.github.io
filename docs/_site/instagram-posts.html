TypeScript Union types are a potent tool to model our types.
They are so powerful that they can be Union types or help us model Discriminated Unions.
What's the difference between Union types and Discriminated Unions?
Well, Union types are a way to let a type be either one or another (or multiple actually) things at one point.
In this example "type Player = 'X' | 'O'" the type Player can be either X or O at any point.
Discriminated Unions, however, are a special case of Union Types; they allow one type to be one thing or another based on an identifier.
An example would be "type CellState = { kind: 'Playable' } | { kind: 'Played', player: Player }".
The types are distinguishable thanks to the "kind" property each object posses.
Not all languages possess the power of TypeScript Union type. We might take for granted the power of the TypeScript type system because Unions are one of the most basic types, but they are quite potent.
TypeScript had to develop the Union type as a basic type because the dynamic nature of JavaScript made unions a common pattern, but Union types are a super-advanced topic for statically typed languages.
Some languages cannot have unions of literals like our Player example where the type system discriminated between two string. They can only type strings, but not an actual value.
Other languages need a token to discriminate between the types, so the language only possesses Discriminated Unions and not the more broad generalization that the TypeScript version has.
Are you happy that TypeScript types are so formidable?

I'm learning some Scala lately in my effort to know more about functional programming.
I started with F# as a functional-first language, now I'm trying scala which has more features and bigger ecosystems thanks to the JVM.
Have you tried Scala? Any useful resource to learn more about Scala you can recommend to us in the comments?

I'm a huge advocate of clean code, but also with time and practice, I have understood that it's not a silver bullet.
It does not translate to right code, or good problem solving, or faster problem solver.
Not even make teams happier, some people just don't fucking care and will destroy you clean code without any remorse, might even hold a grudge are you for trying.
Yet, some people do get it, and we should know each other because we are the ones who appreciate it.
As with anything in life, some people don't get why justice and ethics are substantial, and others do.
And that's how you know you're working with the right people because they share your principles.
If you have any anecdotes regarding dirty or clean code, 🧼 let me know in the comments. 👇

And it is designed to make you deal with many control cases often ignored by programmers, which makes you look like a better programmer!
And that's not by mistake; it is the primary goal of Go.

What's your story about internet privacy? Does it worry you?
I have trouble getting out of Google/Chrome/Safari. The convenience is so huge!!
But I get that's the point; they are making money out of us and paying back with super well designed-convenient apps.
It shouldn't be the case, tho; we just got so used to free stuff! Now privacy is valued, yet we still spect it from free apps; otherwise, people won't convert.
Are you not convinced?
People use DuckDuckGo instead of Google Chrome because it's private yet free. People use Signal instead of Whatsapp because it's private yet free. People use 1Password because it keeps passwords safe yet it's free!
We hope some people figure out how to make private and secure apps for free, and maybe we'll convert, what a complicated expectation to live up to for new tech companies.
Should privacy come at a cost? Or should it be free?

If you wish to buy this sticker, the link is in my bio 🎯
I use Puppeteer for testing because more times than not Cypress has some weird edge case where I can't use it.
Puppeteer is fast, it might not be as "friendly" for testing as other libs, but you can always create your matches dedicated to Puppeteer or use some from npm.
What I like most about it is the uniform API, so simple yet so powerful.
You can screenshot things, snapshot things, execute things in the Browser and in Node too.

I can't think many lines of code that make me happier.
Yarn is faster and way more reliable than npm, even to this day.
I wish Node.js could have come with a more storage-friendly solution than node_modules, but at least we've got yarn.

Obvs this is the cutest design I've found so far, what do you think of it?
This design is available for purchase in 49 diff products, link in my bio ✨
This artist has adorable designs, and it looks lovely in a pillow.
I plan to do more Instagram story polls to see which one are other designs you might like.
I'm trying to see what type of content is more Instagram friendly, and maybe leave more tech-heavy things to Medium (blog) and YouTube.
Why? Because Instagram content is not indexable, nor ever-green, so people cannot find things later.
In resume, this is my next ig strategy: - Merch for you - Carrousels about new blog posts - Teasers from new YouTube vids
What do you think?

Don't you get annoyed when you install and app and immediately starts sending you a bunch of notifications?
IT'S THE WORST!
What about the "hey, come see this?" (I'm looking at you tiktok 👀)
Shouldn't that be illegal? Like bad for mental health!
What I do about it? Well, after installing an app is disable all kind of push/email notifications!
But shouldn't this be the default behaviour?
Maybe iOS will make this behavior a default in future versions?

I think I need some minimalist intro, some 1-5 seconds music with maybe a small animation or something.
I love watching YouTube podcasts or channels that have a catching intro and are quick! Just enough to create a familiar environment.
I like when the video has a quick intro to what will be said (without spoilers of course), then the intro comes into place 🎶  and then the video starts.
How do I know an intro is good? When I find myself humming the intro for a few seconds.
I also find channels that have the same intro as the outro, which is nice!
Why am I doing this now?
Well... in my last video I forgot to present myself, and the channel🤦‍♂️. Also, I enjoy too much catching intros/outros to ignore them for much longer.
I didn't want to spend too much time on the video editing process at first, but I do want to improve 1% every week, so I want to add an intro/outro next. ⁣ Want to support me in my journey?⁣ 💬 Leave a comment with good vibes 🙌 Tag a friend you might find this account fascinating 🔔 Turn notifications to know when I publish new stuff ❤️ Destroy the like button

I think a found a good rival to Mozilla's MDN!
📽🎥📹 I talk more about the key things I enjoyed from this site on YouTube, link in bio 🔥
What is web.dev?
Is an effort from the Google Chrome team: A site dedicated to documenting best-practices and the ability to monitor your site to ensure you always were able to keep it fast, resilient and accessible.
On the learning side, they have structured learning paths to discover everything you need to know about building for the modern web, like:
- Performance - Web vitals - Metrics - Fast load times. - Progressive Web Apps - Accessibility - Network reliability - Web Payments - Security - React - Angular - and how to use Lighthouse
All of this is in such a great depth and thought for learners. I must say, the quality of the content is impressive.
On the learning side, you can test: Performance Best Practices SEO and Accessibility The test is free, only requires an URL, and the result has excellent accuracy and tips on improving the score of your website.
❓ Where do you go for references: Mozilla's MDN or Google's web.dev? Or do you go somewhere else?

Access to the user's contacts on a mobile device has been a feature of iOS/Android apps since (almost) the dawn of time. It's one of the most common feature requests I hear from web developers, and is often the key reason they build an iOS/Android app.
Available in Chrome 80 on Android, the Contact Picker API is an on-demand API that allows users to select entries from their contact list and share limited details of the selected entries with a website. It allows users to share only what they want, when they want, and makes it easier for users to reach and connect with their friends and family.
The entry point to the Contact Picker API is navigator.contacts.select(). When called, it returns a promise and shows the contact picker, allowing the user to select the contact(s) they want to share with the site. After selecting what to share and clicking Done, the promise resolves with an array of contacts selected by the user.

The web platform now supports app shortcuts to improve users' productivity and facilitate re-engagement with key tasks.
They allow web developers to provide quick access to a handful of common actions that users need frequently.
Each app shortcut expresses a user intent, each of which is associated with a URL within the scope of your web app. The URL is opened when users activate the app shortcut. Examples of app shortcuts include the following: - Top-level navigation items (e.g., home, timeline, recent orders) - Search - Data entry tasks (e.g., compose an email or tweet, add a receipt) - Activities (e.g., start a chat with the most popular contacts)

There has been 2 kinds of Assignment Operators in JavaScript (besides the actual Assignment Operator =) Arithmetic Assignment Operators, like +=, *=, -=. Bitwise Operators <<=, >>>=, ^=, &=.
But there's a new kind of operators ready for you to use today in JavaScript, called: Logical Assignment Operators.
Today I'm going to show you the Logical OR Assignment.
The logical OR assignment (x ||= y) operator only assigns if x is falsy.
The logical OR operator works like this:
x || y; // returns x when x is truthy // returns y when x is not truthy
The logical OR operator short-circuits: the second operand is only evaluated if the first operand doesn’t already determine the result.
Logical OR assignment short-circuits as well, meaning it only performs an assignment if the logical operation would evaluate the right-hand side. In other words, x ||= y is equivalent to:
x || (x = y);
And not equivalent to the following which would always perform an assignment:
x = x || y;
Note that this behavior is different to mathematical and bitwise assignment operators.

If you’ve never heard about the OpenJS Foundation, you probably have two questions in mind, let me answer those:
What is the purpose of the OpenJS Foundation?
-Promote the widespread adoption and development of key JavaScript solutions and related technologies.
And where did they come from? - 2006 jQuery is created. - 2009 jQuery Joins the Software Freedom Conservancy - 2012 jQuery Foundation, as an independent organization is formed. - 2016 Dojo Foundation merges with jQuery Foundation, later rebranding itself as JS Foundation, and becomes a Linux Foundation Program. - 2019 The Node.js Foundation merges with the JS Foundation to form OpenJS Foundation, to foster healthy growth of the JavaScript and web ecosystem as a whole.

Lo repetiré de nuevo, HACER LAS PRUEBAS. 👩‍💻 Para vencer el fricción de sentarte y hacer pruebas, tienes que dejar ir la mentalidad que tienes al programar una característica principal, no es igual, tienes que estar abierto a ver las cosas desde otra perspectiva y tienes que cultivar esa mentalidad. 👨‍💻 Vivien Ibironke Ibiyemi, tiene algo llamado “Mindset tool”(MT) que podría traducirlo como “Herramienta de Mentalidad”, las consiguió observando como los demás eran mejor que ella encontrando bugs, ella define algunas: 👩‍💻 🧠 MT de Usuario. 🧠 MT Ya probé. 🧠 MT de Lazy Tester. 🧠 MT Analítica. 🧠 MT de Pensamiento crítico. 🧠 MT de Curiosidad. 🧠 MT de Convicción de errores. 🧠 MT de Comunicador. 🧠 MT de Confianza, Empresarial. 🧠 MT Líder del equipo. 🧠 MT de Manejo de críticas y acusaciones. 🧠 MT de Manejo de la vergüenza. 👨‍💻 Cambiando su perspectiva, esta mejor preparada para afrontar la situación y ¿acaso ser un programador no es ver el mundo desde otra perspectiva completamente distinta? 👩‍💻 Etiqueta a un amigo (o empresa) que necesite este consejo 📦 👨‍💻 ¿Te gustaría que explicase las Herramientas de Mentalidad de Vivien? déjame un comentario 👇

Es decir, quick-check se encarga de generar datos (string vacío, extremadamente largo, con caracteres especiales, etc), la distribución de estos datos, estadísticos entenderán la importancia, y corre muchas veces la prueba con todos estos datos para asegurar que la función correctamente maneja esto.
Esto no solo significa que te ayuda a automatizar casos de prueba tediosos, sino que lo mas probable encuentre bugs que nunca pensaste que existían en tu código, tanto es así que las implementaciones de QuickCheck siempre se enorgullecen de encontrar errores en librerías altamente utilizadas (fast-check incluso encontró un bug en Jest 😳. ¿Qué piensas de este método 🤔? ¿lo conocías?
